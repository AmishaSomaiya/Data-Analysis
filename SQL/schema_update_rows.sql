/* update rows Table, movies

In addition to adding new data, a common task is to update existing data, which can be done using an UPDATE statement. Similar to the INSERT statement, you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update. In addition, the data you are updating has to match the data type of the columns in the table schema.
The statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs, and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause.

Always write the constraint first and test it in a SELECT query to make sure you are updating the right rows, and only then writing the column/value pairs to update.
