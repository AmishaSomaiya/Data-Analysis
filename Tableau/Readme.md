Title : 'Analysis of Global Female Employment Trends : 1991-2021'
The goal is to give the viewer a clear idea of global female employment over a time period of 1991 to 2021. All data fields are used raw for this viz. Starting with the 3 charts in the bottom of the dashboard,these give female employment breakdown in services, agriculture and industry over the years. The same statistics for males is also visualized in layered fashion in the same plots for quick and easy comparison. Chart type: layered, Mark: continous line. X axis encoding: year (even numbered years shown for spaced out axis view). Y axis encoding : percentage for each year. Color encoding: Female: blue, Male: orange The line ends are labeled for quicker view. These encodings are maintained through all 3 bottom graphs in both visualizations for uniformity. Moving up to the right is the literacy rate and salaried women(subset of employment in services) stacked bar chart. Chart type: stacked bar chart, Encoding: x axis: percentage, y axis: year (even numbered), Color encoding: Blue: salaried women, Teal: Literacy Rate for females. To the left of this chart, is the Global Female Labor Force map showing percentage of female labor out of total labor for all countries in 2021. Encoding: color scheme : teal-blue color from min(7.79%) to max(64.27%) in 10 steps. Last, in the top-most are the single statistics data frames for female employment taken raw from data for 2021.
