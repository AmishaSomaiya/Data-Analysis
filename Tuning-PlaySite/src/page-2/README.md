# Rigorous rationale for page2 design decisions.

## Introduction:
Setting and optimizing hyperparameters is a critical task in machine learning models. These hyperparameters significantly influence the performance and effectiveness of the models. Among the various hyperparameters, batch size plays a crucial role as it impacts the training process and model performance. Understanding the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy is essential for effectively tuning hyperparameters and achieving optimal model performance. This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into this relationship and offer guidance for hyperparameter optimization.

## Rationale for Designing the Page:
The decision to dedicate a specific page to the exploration of the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy stems from the realization that this topic is often misunderstood or accompanied by misconceptions. Many practitioners and researchers may have misconceptions regarding the impact of batch size on model performance. By addressing these misconceptions and providing a clear understanding of the relationship, we aim to help users optimize their models and avoid common pitfalls.


## Objective of the Page:
The primary objective of this page is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy. By visualizing the data and showcasing the trends and patterns, we aim to demonstrate the impact of different batch sizes on model performance. Additionally, we seek to dispel misconceptions and clarify that while increasing batch size can have a linear effect on accuracy, it is crucial to optimize other hyperparameters for individual batch sizes to achieve the best performance. This analysis will help users make informed decisions and optimize their models accordingly. The page is strategically placed as the second page, immediately following the introduction, to capture the readers' attention and provide a smooth transition into the detailed exploration of hyperparameter optimization.

## Design Considerations:
To effectively communicate the insights and facilitate understanding, several design decisions were made.

Firstly, the inclusion of three charts serves to provide a comprehensive analysis. The first chart presents a general overview of the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy, highlighting the linear effect of increasing batch size. However, it also emphasizes the need to consider other hyperparameters for optimal performance.

The second chart aims to demonstrate that the impact of batch size on model performance is highly dependent on other hyperparameters. By optimizing the hyperparameters individually for each batch size, the chart showcases that there is no significant effect of increasing batch size on the model's performance. This insight is crucial in dispelling the misconception that larger batch sizes always lead to better performance.

Lastly, the third chart introduces theoretical expectations and actual performance, shedding light on the complexities of hyperparameter tuning. By comparing these two lines, users can understand that the actual performance may deviate from theoretical expectations, further emphasizing the need for careful hyperparameter optimization.

The decision to use line graphs for visualizing the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy allows for a clear representation of the continuous nature of the relationship. Line graphs effectively showcase trends and patterns over a range of values, enabling users to grasp the impact of batch size on model performance.

In terms of size, each chart was designed to fit within a 500x500-pixel space, ensuring a visually appealing and balanced layout while allowing for easy viewing and interpretation. This size provides enough room to display the data without overwhelming the readers.

Color choices were carefully considered to aid in differentiating between user predictions and actual data. Blue was selected to represent user-drawn elements, symbolizing predictions, while red was chosen to represent actual or reference data. This color scheme enhances the clarity and understanding of the visualization.

Scaling methods were chosen based on the characteristics of the data. The first and second charts utilize a logarithmic scale (base 2) for the X-axis to accommodate a wide range of batch sizes. This scale evenly spreads the data points and enhances visibility, particularly for smaller batch sizes. The Y-axis in both charts employs a linear scale, providing an intuitive representation of the validation accuracy values.

Additionally, the inclusion of interactive elements, such as the ability to draw user predictions and compare them with actual data, enhances user engagement and promotes a deeper understanding of the relationship. This interactivity encourages users to actively participate in the analysis and reinforces the importance of considering other hyperparameters alongside batch size.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the design decisions, including the choice of line graphs, consistent chart sizes, appropriate color selection, scaling methods, and interactive features, were carefully implemented to support the objectives of effective communication and insightful exploration of hyperparameter optimization. This visual analysis allows users to intuitively comprehend the relationship between batch size and validation accuracy, aiding in the decision-making process for optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning models.
