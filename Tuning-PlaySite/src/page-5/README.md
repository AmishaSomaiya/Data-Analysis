The purpose of this page is to present information about different hyperparameters for tuning convolutional neural networks and their commonly used values. Initially, we compiled a list of all the hyperparameters, which appeared in a hierarchical flow. We attempted to visualize them using tree maps, but the team felt that the aesthetics were not satisfactory. Then, we explored node-link diagrams due to the presence of multiple subcategories within each category. We experimented with a radial tree layout, but it resulted in excessive white spaces due to the limited data available. Eventually, we concluded that sunburst trees would be the ideal choice considering our limited dataset.

### Design
We followed a similar design to the sunburst visualization provided in the d3 gallery. The node width was evenly divided among the categories and subcategories. We added text to each node and ensured that only the text that fit within the node was displayed, avoiding any overlaps between the text. After establishing the basic structure, we focused on interactivity. Clicking on a node would display the entire view of the clicked node as the root, with its subcategories distributed throughout the entire circle. Clicking on the center would revert to the previous root node. We selected a color-blind-safe palette that complements a white background.

Feedback from the milestone review suggested that using a sunburst visualization was unnecessary since every node was clearly visible, making the process of clicking nodes to see subcategories redundant. Therefore, we expanded the visualization by adding more hyperparameters. Importantly, we changed the node width to indicate the importance of tuning the specific hyperparameter mentioned in each node. This approach provides additional information while giving a purpose to node interactivity. We made various minor adjustments, such as modifying the radius, text size, and node width, to ensure that the visualization fits on a single page, eliminating the need for scrolling.
